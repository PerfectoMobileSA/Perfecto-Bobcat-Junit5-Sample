### Steps to integrate with Perfecto </br>

1. Clone/ Download this project.</br>

2. Run gradle tasks:</br> 

	`gradle clean build test -Dwebdriver.url={Perfecto cloud url. E.g. https://demo.perfectomobile.com/nexperience/perfectomobile/wd/hub/fast} -Dwebdriver.cap.securityToken={Perfecto Security token} -Dbobcat.config.contexts={Bobcat context. E.g. chrome/firefox/perfectoAndroid}`</br>

### Jenkins CI Dashboard integration:
1. Setup a job in any CI like Jenkins.</br>
2. Create a build task -> Execute shell.</br>
3. Enter the below shell command and run your job :</br>

	`gradle clean build test -Dwebdriver.url={Perfecto cloud url. E.g. https://demo.perfectomobile.com/nexperience/perfectomobile/wd/hub/fast} -Dwebdriver.cap.securityToken={Perfecto security token} -Dreportium-job-name=${JOB_NAME} -Dreportium-job-number=${BUILD_NUMBER} -Dbobcat.config.contexts={Bobcat context. E.g. chrome/firefox/perfectoAndroid}` </br>

#### Note:

1. Substitute your Perfecto URL and securityToken respectively (without flower brackets)/ pass them as job parameters.</br>

2. ${JOB_NAME} & ${BUILD_NUMBER} are Jenkins internal environment variables which will return the job name and current job number.</br>

3. This [link](https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/PD/Generate+security+tokens) will showcase how to generate Perfecto security token.</br>

4. Note: Enter the physical location of gradle if it wasnt identified by Jenkins while executing.</br>

#### Known Issue:

When webdriver.reusable property is set to True, the driver instance remains open even after running all the tests, Due to this [issue](https://github.com/wttech/bobcat/issues/437), the build will be failure even though all the tests passes.
